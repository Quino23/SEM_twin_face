# SEM_twin_face

This repository includes .R scripts to make univariate and multivariate twin SEM models as found in this [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921000136?dgcid=rss_sd_all). In both cases MZ- and DZ-specific data frames (named "MZ", "DZ", "MZ_atlas" and "DZ_atlas") must be provided and arranged in a single-row format. That is, both twins of a pair in the same row. The variables' names must be identical except for the ending, which indicates the twin ID (e.g., variable_T1, variable_T2).
